----

highcharts: -ask xav to demonstrate highcharts (but i think that once the script is in the doc head, you just make a div with an id, and create a jquery object for that title with the method .highcharts(); inside the (), you pass parameters for chart type, tile, x-axis, y-axis, etc, based on highcharts api documentation - so select a chart type first, then put it in. q: how do you get the data in there??)

----

jquery: var toGet = $('input[name=inputName]').val();
